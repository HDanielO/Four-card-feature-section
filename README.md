## My process

It's been a while. But I can finally say I'm back. This year has been a long for me, with my laptop's bacteria literally swelling and my just concluded overwhelming school semester contributed in me taking a long break. So this is like a "welcome back" revison package üòÖ.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Before I did this challenge I had to do a little bit of relearning. To my disappointment I found out that I had forgotten lots of basic things, so I had to start all the way from the basics. Yes, Semantic HTML.

Big thank you to Dr Angela. Your course on Udemy really kickstart the passion for programming I thought I had lost.

I was able to learn and perfect my knowledge on sizing, media queries, Bootstrap, grid and flexbox.

### Continued development

After this project I plan to build a couple more projects with HTML and CSS for now to really get in the groove. Then I'll move on to the next big guy, Javascript. Before my unintended break, I had started learning JS, albeit I was still a beginner. Hopefully, It's going to be a fun ride. I hope to code more projects with JS in the near future

### Useful resources

- [MDN DOCS](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Basically the dictionary of every developer. Useful if you really want to look up a css property or a piece of code you mighr have forgotten or not understood.

- [Bard AI](https://bard.google.com/) - Another got sent to me this year lol. It helped me understood concepts or definitions that I didn't really understand when I read the docs. Basically like that teacher that breaks down definitions for you.
- [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](hhttps://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) - This course on Udemy really helped me so I just have to include it. If you are a newbie and you are looking for that complete all rounder course for web development then this is for you. Hehehe, thank me Laterüòâ.
